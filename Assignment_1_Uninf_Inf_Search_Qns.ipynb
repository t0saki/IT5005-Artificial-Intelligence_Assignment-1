The Maze has 16 rows and 24 columns The objective is to find a shortest path from cell $S$ to cell $G$.\n","\n","\n","![Maze](Maze.jpg)\n","\n","\n","The agent can take four actions in each cell: 'RIGHT', 'DOWN', 'UP', 'LEFT'.  \n","\n","Each cell is represented as $(x,y)$, where $x$ indicates row number and $y$ indicates column number. Action 'UP' takes the agent from cell $(x,y)$ to $(x+1,y)$. Action 'DOWN' takes the agent from cell $(x,y)$ to $(x-1,y)$. Action 'RIGHT' takes the agent from cell $(x,y)$ to $(x,y+1)$. Action 'LEFT' takes the agent from cell $(x,y)$ to $(x,y-1)$. The triplet $(s,a,s')$  indicates that taking action $a$ at state $s$ leads to state $s'$. Actions 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' cost 10 units for all $(s,a,s')$. Actions 'UP' or 'DOWN' cost 1 unit for all  $(s,a,s')$.  The agent cannot move into cells that are shaded. Assume that the agent knows the boundaries of the maze and has full observability. Consequently, at the bottom (row 0) and top (row 15), the agent will not take actions 'DOWN' and 'UP', respectively; at left (column 0) and right (column 23) columns, the agent will not take 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT' actions, respectively.
